    <h2>This classic, creamy pumpkin soup is so delicious and healthy</h2>

    <p>
      Pumpkin soup is a usually 'bound' soup made from a purée of pumpkin. It is
      made by combining the meat of a blended pumpkin with broth or stock. It
      can be served hot or cold, and is a common Thanksgiving dish.

      <li>1kg pumpkin, peeled and chopped</li>
      <li>2-3 teaspoons reduced-salt vegetable stock powder</li>
      <li>3 cups boiling water</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>1 medium brown onion, chopped</li>

      <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
      <li>1 cup skim milk</li>
      <li>1/4 cup reduced-fat sour cream, to serve</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons chopped roasted nuts and seeds</li>
    </ul>

    <br />

    <h3>Steps:</h3>

    <ol class="steps">
      <li>
        In a large heavy-based pan, place pumpkin, stock powder and boiling
        water. Cover and bring to the boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 15 to 20
        minutes, or until softened.
      </li>

      <li>
        Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium-high. Sauté onion
        and garlic for 3 or 4 minutes, or until onion is softened. Add cumin and
        nutmeg and cook for 30 seconds. Add milk and season with cracked black
        pepper.
      </li>

      <li>
        Remove pumpkin from heat. Pour milk mixture into pumpkin mixture. Using
        a stick blender, carefully blend until smooth. Return to stove and
        reheat, if needed.
      </li>

      <li>
        Divide soup among four bowls. Swirl over sour cream and scatter with
        chopped nuts and seeds.
      </li>
